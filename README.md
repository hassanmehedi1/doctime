# DocMic By Mehedi Hassan

## This is a full react website. For styling tailwind css is used along with vanilla css. I made this website full responsive for mobile, tab and desktop. I also added some extra styling for good design and look purpose. All the part and components are custom made by me and I collected the photos from given figma file.

### I had some extra time left thats why tried to add a new feature. For that I have implemented animation's in the landing page to make the page more interactive and interesting. I hope that you would like it.
